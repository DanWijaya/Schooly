## The idea behind this project: 
This idea came about during Covid-19 when all schools and educational institutions had to pivot to online forms of learning. 
My friend and I had an idea to build a Learning Management System to facilitate schools in conducting day-to-day teaching and learning.

## This project uses the following technologies:

React and React Router for frontend
Express and Node for the backend
MongoDB for the database
Redux for state management between React components
Dropbox API SDK to integrate the file sharing system in the application
