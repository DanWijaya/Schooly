## The idea behind this project: 
This idea came about during Covid-19 when all schools and educational institutions had to pivot to online forms of learning. 
My friend and I had an idea to build a Learning Management System to facilitate schools in conducting day-to-day teaching and learning.

## This project uses the following technologies:

* React and React Router for frontend
* Express and Node for the backend
* MongoDB for the database
* Redux for state management between React components
* Dropbox API SDK to integrate the file sharing system in the application

## To run this project
* Clone the project
* On terminal or command prompt, Go to directory WebApp
* Run `npm install` and wait until it is completed
* Once completed sucessfully, Go to directory client
* Run `npm install` and wait until it is completed
* Once everything is completed, go to directory WebApp
* Run `npm run dev`. You will be able to access the site at localhost:3000. (The frontend is runned at port 3000, while the ExpressJS server is runned at port 5000)
